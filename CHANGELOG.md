# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2020-10-21

### Added

- Added a [`withSavepoint`](README.md#withSavepoint) function for creating
  savepoints. Savepoints can be used to simulate nested transactions.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-10-19

### Added

- Added a `sql.json` function for serializing values as JSON in queries.
  Strictly speaking, this isn't necessary, since it is mostly just equivalent
  to `JSON.stringify`, but I'm including it since it might be more readable.
- Added an optional row parser parameter to [`query`](README.md#query),
  [`queryOne`](README.md#queryOne) and [`queryMaybeOne`](README.md#queryMaybeOne).

### Changed

- Changed the default type variable in [`query`](README.md#query),
  [`queryOne`](README.md#queryOne) and
  [`queryMaybeOne`](README.md#queryMaybeOne) from `any` to `unknown`. Now the
  user must explicitly cast the result rows to another type or to use a
  validating row parser.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-10-09

### Fixed

- Fixed the `files` and `types` entries in package.json. With them, the
  project should actually be usable ðŸ™‚.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-10-09

### Changed

- Changed `withTransactionLevel` and `withTransactionMode` to take the
  isolation level and access mode as the first argument. This allows the user
  to fix them more easily with e.g. `Function.prototype.bind`.
- Replaced `TooManyRowsReturnedError` and `NoRowsReturnedError` with a generic
  `ResultError`, which signifies that a query returned an unexpected result.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-10-08

### Added

- Added [`withTransactionLevel`](README.md#withTransactionLevel)
  and [`withTransactionMode`](README.md#withTransactionMode).

### Changed

- Renamed `transaction` to [`withTransaction`](README.md#withTransaction).

## [0.1.0] - 2020-10-07

- Initial public release
